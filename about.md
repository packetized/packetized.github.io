I'm a fairly whelmed bit plumber, working and doing technically sweet networking-type-stuff for Salesforce.com in San Francisco, CA. Started this blog as a way of keeping track of some of the projects and moderately interesting things I'm doing outside of the office.

## Things I am good at:

* Trivia
* Computing in general, networking & monitoring in specific
* Automation-type stuff - nothing is more satisfying than doing something cleverly on a lot of systems at once
* Fixing things until they're broken
